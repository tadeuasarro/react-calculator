          Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&apos;t all sunshine and
          rainbows. It&apos;s a very mean and nasty place and I don&apos;t care how tough
          you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let
          it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&apos;t about how
          hard ya hit. It&apos;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much
          you can take and keep moving forward. That&apos;s how winning is done!
